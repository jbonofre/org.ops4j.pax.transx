Pax TransX aims at providing support for JTA/JTS transaction management in OSGi, along with resource pooling for JDBC and JMS.

This is the official source repository of the OPS4J Pax TransX project.

## Build

You'll need a machine with Java 8 and Apache Maven 3 installed.

Checkout:

    git clone git://github.com/ops4j/org.ops4j.pax.transx.git

Run Build:

    mvn clean install


## Releases

The latest release is 0.1.0 and can be found in [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ops4j/pax/transx).

## Karaf Deployment

Pax-TransX provides features to easily integrate in Apache Karaf.
```
> repo-add mvn:org.ops4j.pax.transx/pax-transx-features/0.1.0/xml/features
> feature:install pax-transx-tm-narayana
```

## Transaction Manager API

The TransX Transaction Manager API aims to provide a common facade for transaction 
managers so that one can code against various transaction managers without caring about
the specifics.
In addition to the basic transaction management capabilities, the API provides a facade for:
 * Recovery
 * Last Resource Commit
 
The [Transaction Manager](https://github.com/ops4j/org.ops4j.pax.transx/blob/master/pax-transx-tm-api/src/main/java/org/ops4j/pax/transx/tm/TransactionManager.java) 
is the main entry point of the API.

## Recovery

Transactional resources must be wrapped into [ResourceFactories](https://github.com/ops4j/org.ops4j.pax.transx/blob/master/pax-transx-tm-api/src/main/java/org/ops4j/pax/transx/tm/ResourceFactory.java) 
and registered in the Transaction Manager.  This will trigger the recovery mechanism.

## Last Resource Commit

If a transactional resource does not support XA, the XAResource wrapping this resource should also implement [LastResource].
Transaction managers that support LRC will ensure that such resources are prepared last, ensuring some consistency even with no native XA support.
 
 ## Transaction Manager implementations
 
 Pax TransX supports 3 different implementations based on the following transaction managers:
  * Geronimo
  * Narayana
  * Atomikos
All three implementations supports recovery of inflight transactions, 
and Geronimo and Narayana transaction managers support Last-Resource-Commit.

## JDBC

A JDBC DataSource with pooling and XA support can be created in the following way:
```
return ManagedDataSourceBuilder.builder()
        .transactionManager(tm)
        .name("h2invm")
        .dataSource(xaDataSource)
        .build();
```

## JMS

A JMS ConnectionFactory with pooling an XA support can be created in the following way:
```
return ManagedConnectionFactoryBuilder.builder()
        .transactionManager(tm)
        .name("vmbroker")
        .connectionFactory(new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(brokerUrl),
                           new ActiveMQXAConnectionFactory(brokerUrl))
        .build();
```

Note that the wrapped ConnectionFactory will support JMS 2.0, only relying 
on JMS 1.1 for the underlying connection factories.
